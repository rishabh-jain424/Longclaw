# Longclaw
This project is concerned with developing an image editor using Python. We used various packages like Tkinter, pillow, OpenCV and many more. It is a user interactive and easy to use application.

Following steps are considered to edit a desired image:
- This software system first allows the user to choose an image from your local computer or from webcam.
- A menu bar on the top of the screen and the buttons at left side of the screen provide this functionality.
- The menu bar allows the user to open a new image and save an edited image in your computer.
- The user may adjust image contrast and various ways to enhance image.
- Users can even find edges and contour of the image.
- It also allows the user rotate the image as needed.
- Application also allows user to add grayscale, posterize and invert effect to the image.
- It also provide user to cure the images which contain grains using various blurring techniques.
- Finally user may save the edited file as needed.
- In addition to the above, user can also open, save, save_as the image in a chosen location by keyboard shortcuts: - <Control-o>, <Control-s>, <Control-Shift-s> respectively.
